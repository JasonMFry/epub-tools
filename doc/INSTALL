Installation information for the Windows binary distribution


First, understand that this is command-line software. You don't run
it with the mouse. There is no icon. It's not going in your Start
menu. It's to be run from within a command shell.


These epub tools will run from the Windows cmd.exe shell.

Even better, what I would do is install the cygwin tools and run
them from a bash or similar shell. Having cygwin in place, I would
place the binaries in /usr/local/bin, which should be on your PATH
in cygwin shells. And you're good to go.


For help, try this in your shell:

   > epubmeta.exe --help
   > epubname.exe --help
   > epubzip.exe --help
