Installation information for the Windows binary distribution


First, understand that this is command-line software. You don't run
it with the mouse. There is no icon. It's not going in your Start
menu. It's to be run from within a command shell.


Although not my preferred way, epubname will run from the Windows
cmd.exe shell.

What I would do is install the cygwin tools and run it from a
bash shell. Having cygwin in place, I would place the binary in
/usr/local/bin, which should be on your PATH in cygwin shells. And
you're good to go.


If you're confused about how to use epubname, do this in your shell:

   > epubname.exe --help
