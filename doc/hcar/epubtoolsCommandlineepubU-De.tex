A suite of command-line utilities for creating and manipulating epub book files. Included are: epubmeta, epubname, epubzip.

epubmeta is a command-line utility for examining and editing epub book metadata. With it you can export, import and edit the raw OPF Package XML document for a given book. Or simply dump the metadata to stdout for viewing in a friendly format.

epubname is a command-line utility for renaming epub ebook files based on the metadata. It tries to use author names and title info to construct a sensible name.

epubzip is a handy utility for zipping up the files that comprise an epub into an .epub zip file. Using the same technology as epubname, it can try to make a meaningful filename for the book.

This project is built on the latest epub-metadata library and so supports epub3 for the first time.
