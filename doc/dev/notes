-----
This project may benefit from the use of some other tools out here
such as epubcheck, zip and unzip

- Tools unzipping can try to fall back on unzip upon failure

- epubmeta needs write capability

- epub creation, think about this

- always release Windows binaries

- OSX too?


## Found some old notesbook notes about the DSL:

I think this was maybe about a less-flat more language-like DSL with recursive interpretation. But this is not how the software runs today. Maybe it should in the future?

    aut  (aut)
    idx  (idx 2)
    lit  some string
    mnum (mnum (idx 2))
    pad  (pad 2 (idx 1))
    publ (publ)
    scr  (scr (idx 3))
    wnum (wnum 3 (idx 4))
    year (year)
