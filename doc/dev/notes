Trying to unify my epub manipulation utilities into one project

Utils included here:

- epubmeta (move from epub-metadata project)
- epub-repair (move from scripts project)
- epub-zip (move from scripts project)
+ epubname (move from epubname project


This project may benefit from the use of some other tools out here
such as epubcheck, zip and unzip

- Tools unzipping can try to fall back on unzip upon failure

- epubmeta needs write capability

- epub creation, think about this

- always release Windows binaries

- OSX too?
