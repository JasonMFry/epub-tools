What is the overall progression?

- For each book (this is an ErrorT action):
   - Parse the metadata
   - Try formatters on the metadata, fail if we have no formatter that fits
      - This is a foldr mplus operation on the list of possible formatters
        We want the first one that works, if possible.
   - Rename with the new filename, fail if we can't do this rename
