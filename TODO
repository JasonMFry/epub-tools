general

- Some notes in README about installing epubcheck if possible

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like this:
   <dc:date opf:event="original-publication">2011</dc:date>

   Also take a peek at all the date fields in all the books, what do they collectively look like?

epubmeta

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line
