- Some notes in README about installing epubcheck if possible

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like this:
   <dc:date opf:event="publication">2011</dc:date>

   Perhaps as part of epubmeta?

- Perform util/win-dist.sh behavior in post-build step of Setup.hs? I think it makes sense.

epubmeta

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line

- Ability to dump the actual Haskell Metadata structure out. Could be used to make unit tests for epubname.

-----
epubname

- Maybe have an interactive mode that shows the changes and asks?
   Seeing a usage pattern where I use -n first and then run again without -n. Thinking about streamlining that process.
