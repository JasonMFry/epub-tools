- Complete usage in Opts

- Update unit tests. They don't work at all now.

- Add a new test: Input file paths with spaces

- Update licensing year

- Need to reinstate those negative "simple" tests. They do a lot of testing for difficult titles (which is commonFilters)

- Put BSD3 licensing info on all source files and anything else that's relevant
