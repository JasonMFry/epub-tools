general

- Some notes in README about installing epubcheck if possible

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like this:
   <dc:date opf:event="publication">2011</dc:date>

   Perhaps as part of epubmeta?

- Perform util/win-dist.sh behavior in post-build step of Setup.hs? I think it makes sense.

-----
epubmeta

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line

- Ability to dump the actual Haskell Metadata structure out. Could be used to make unit tests for epubname.

-----
epubname

- Maybe have an interactive mode that shows the changes and asks?
   Seeing a usage pattern where I use -n first and then run again without -n. Thinking about streamlining that process.

- Extensive documentation in share, viewed when you do --help or maybe --help-?? some switch for more detailed info

- Try to make tests of formatters into a conf file thing as well. This is kind of important. Not part of HUnit or QC

- magFsf is maybe a tiny bit too generic. It gets a lot of things that it shouldn't with ease.

- Fix end of name .epub suffix

- Fix separator between author and title

- Fix separator between title and pubyear

- Better location for default.epubname  Needs to be deployed and this has to work right from epubname.hs  i.e. What's the conf file search path?

- Can possibly parallelize book renaming, each book is an atomic operation. Look into it.

- New module hierarchy:
   EpubName/
      Format/
         Author
         Compile
         Format
         PutYear
         Util
      Opts
      Test/
         Compile
         Test

- Move these functions to Format.Format: Util.
   capFirstAndDeSpace, commonFilters, filterCommon

   And give them smarter names

- Need to separate commonFilters to make sure to never make a crazy, illegal filename. Even if nobody ever calls Format.Format.scrub

- Commit these large architecture changes

- Fix Format.addPublisher code. It's currently commented out.
