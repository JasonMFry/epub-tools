- Some notes in README about installing epubcheck if possible

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like this:
   <dc:date opf:event="publication">2011</dc:date>

   Perhaps as part of epubmeta?

epubmeta

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line

- Ability to dump the actual Haskell Metadata structure out. Could be used to make unit tests for epubname.
