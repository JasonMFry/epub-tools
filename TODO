- Add a new test: Books with a metadata field consisting of more than one line. May need parsec to parse this multiline business.
  Example book with this situation: MerrifieldSteve-Harvest.epub

- Add a new test: Input file paths with spaces

- Update licensing year

- Try to make this still work with .lrf files and with .epub from other sources (like Feedbooks, Webscriptions)

- Need to reinstate those negative "simple" tests. They do a lot of testing for difficult titles (which is commonFilters)

- Put BSD3 licensing info on all source files and anything else that's relevant

- Extract the file extension from the File: key in Fields
