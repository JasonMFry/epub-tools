general

- Some notes in README about installing epubcheck if possible

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like this:
   <dc:date opf:event="publication">2011</dc:date>

   Perhaps as part of epubmeta?

- Perform util/win-dist.sh behavior in post-build step of Setup.hs? I think it makes sense.

epubmeta

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line

- Ability to dump the actual Haskell Metadata structure out. Could be used to make unit tests for epubname.

-----
epubname

- BUG: default.rules file is searched for in installation dir *before* ~/.epubtools/  TOTALLY WRONG!

- I'd like to see the author name formatting be more flexible so you can opt to not have it call scrubString as is mandatory now.

- Extensive documentation in share, viewed when you do --help or maybe --help-?? some switch for more detailed info

   Be sure to document rules file search paths too

   Document commenting syntax

- Try to make tests of formatters into a conf file thing as well. This is kind of important. Not part of HUnit or QC
   module hierarchy:
      EpubName/
         Test/
            Compile
            Test

- Docs can talk about custom rules here: $HOME/.epubname/default.rules or similar

- Can possibly parallelize book renaming, each book is an atomic operation. Look into it.
