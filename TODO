general

- README.md changes:
   - installing epubcheck if possible
   - less-obscure example book naming sessions
   - demonstration of interactive mode
   - encourage users to contact the developer (see below in epubname as well)

- Windows binary docs:
   - make INSTALL more nicely worded
   - add information or maybe a batch file for assisting with globs and cmd

- Use Paths_epub_tools version instead of hard-coded version in the Opts modules. Test this on Windows.

- Would like to way to be able to insert a publishing year tag into the OPF data like these:
   <dc:date opf:event="publication">2011</dc:date>
   <dc:date opf:event="original-publication">2011</dc:date>
   <dc:subject>anthology</dc:subject>

   Perhaps as part of epubmeta?

- Perform util/win-dist.sh behavior in post-build step of Setup.hs? I think it makes sense.

-----
epubmeta

- When a backup is made during -e[SUF], make a note of it on stdout

- Maybe more options for modifying metadata from the command-line

- Ability to dump the actual Haskell Metadata structure out. Could be used to make unit tests for epubname.

-----
epubname

- in usage, encourage users to contact the developer

- Add info in the usage about submitting metadata to me using epubmeta when there are problems.

- Rethink that Publisher business, maybe get rid of it.

- I'd like to see the author name formatting be more flexible so you can opt to not have it call scrubString as is mandatory now.

- Try to make tests of formatters into a conf file thing as well. This is kind of important. Not part of HUnit or QC
   module hierarchy:
      EpubName/
         Test/
            Compile
            Test

- Can possibly parallelize book renaming, each book is an atomic operation. Look into it.
